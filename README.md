# toys
Game of Life, Cellular Automata Mandala, simple neural network artwork and more!

A box of old toys I made.

- bernoulli_poly.py is a simple visualization of what the bernoulli polynomials look like, how they approximate functions
- life.py is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life
- lorenz_butterfly.py is the Lorenz butterfly.
- mandala.py is a cellular automata with rules that give rise to a mandala.
- nn_art.py randomly initializes a neural network that is used to create a picture. My current profile picture is generated from this!
- rule_30.py and rule_90.py are visualizations of [1D cellular automata](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) (rule 30 and rule 90 respectively)
